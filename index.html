										<h2>About <strong>Oscar</strong></h2>
									</header>
									<p>It was many moons ago when he found an old Spanish guitar in the storage cupboard, he hasn’t stopped playing music since that day. He soon learnt how to put a few chords together and became obsessed with guitars, formed a few bands and decided to study and pursue a music career in England.</p>
									<br />
									<p>He has previously recorded and toured as a bass player for different pop/rock bands in the UK and abroad. Oscar currently shares his time playing guitar in function and tribute bands around the country, teaching music via Skype and local institutions, as well as playing intimate shows as a session guitarist for local singers and songwriters.</p>

										<p>"Oscar is a great teacher and also a great performer showing great knowledge on his instruments but also showing a deep knowledge about music in all fields.  I'm also a musician/performer and Oscar helped me to understand better the ways music can be composed and played helping me opening a wider perception for the comprehension of music.  I highly recommend taking classes with Oscar, it's worth it." </p>

										<p>"I decided to learn keyboard and took lessons from Oscar without any prior music knowledge. I may attended less than 12 classes due to some personal commitments but can certainly say I know some music and have confidence to learn further. I thank Oscar for being inspirational and providing strong foundation. I strongly recommend people especially those like me as beginners to give a try at least 5 classes and see the difference. Thanks."</p>

										<p>"I enjoy all Oscar’s lessons and look forward to them every week. He is a very laid back character but with me doing grades also he helps me focus and achieve what I want to achieve. In lessons we will either look through grades or just play naturally. This is what I like most about him. His ability to listen to the learner and base lessons around what you would like to do but manages to slip in beneficial techniques that you can use later on doing your grade. We always find the right balance of when to 'jam out' and when to take on the grades which Oscar still manages to make fun."</p>
